## about Charisma
* * *
Charisma is a multipurpose discord bot that's literally designed to be better than every other discord bot publically available\
and for the most part, that's slowly becoming a reality
she was built from the ground up with Node.js and Discord's Discord.js API.
no janky Discord libraries written by other people, which makes it much easier to directly control the fundamentals of how Charisma operates.\
<br>
Charisma is constantly getting updated with new features which is slowly making her the "ultimate" Discord bot. she's being built with expandability in mind,
meaning that as a developer, she's extraordinarily easy to add onto because of how Charisma is structured.\

## about me
* * *
my name is red. and that's all you need to know in regards to my identity. but I'll happily indulge you with more info.\
<br>
I'm a software developer, as I'm sure you noticed. I mainly specialize in web development including both client-side and server-side JavaScript.\
professionalism isn't my strongsuit, as I'm sure you can tell by how I don't capitalize the start of my sentences(which is intentional.) I only ever capitalize nouns and a standalone letter i. I am however good at using my words to get across a certain message.\
<br>
I am also very smart. I've designed and developed Charisma entirely by myself along with everything you see on this site, and I intend to keep it that way.
that may sound naive or even selfish, but I'm what you would call a "control freak." I like having absolute control over the things that I create.
It's easier for me to understand how exactly everything works if I was the one that wrote everything.
with that being said, that doesn't mean I'm not open to suggestions(I am), so feel free to join the Charisma Development Server so we can chat.\
